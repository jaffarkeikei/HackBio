# Single-Cell Perturbations Analysis: A Visual Guide

## What is This Project About?

This project helps scientists understand how different drugs affect individual cells. Imagine cells as tiny factories in your body - we want to know what happens when we add different chemicals (drugs) to these factories. Do they work faster? Slower? Do they change their behavior?

## Key Concepts Visualized

### 1. What are Single Cells?
```
                    🔬 Single Cell
                    ┌──────────────┐
                    │   Nucleus    │
                    │   (DNA)      │
                    │     ⚫️       │
                    │             │
                    │  Cytoplasm  │
                    └──────────────┘

### 2. What are Perturbations?
```
Before Drug         After Drug
   Cell               Cell
    ⭕️       →        ❇️
Normal State     Changed State
```

### 3. What We Measure
- Gene Expression (how active different genes are)
- Cell Response (how the cell changes)
- Drug Effects (what the drug does)
